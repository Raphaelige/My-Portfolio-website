    <h1>My Elevator Pitch</h1>
    <p>
      Hi, my name is <strong>Ige Olusola Raphael</strong>.  
      I studied Mass Communication and I’m currently training in Front-End Development with ALX.  
    </p>

    <p>
      I combine creativity with technical skills — from storytelling and content creation to building websites with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
    </p>

    <p>
      My goal is to become a strong front-end developer, create impactful digital solutions, and use technology to open opportunities for businesses and communities.  
    </p>

    <p>
      In short, I’m someone who learns fast, adapts quickly, and is passionate about building things that matter.
