    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hello! My name is <strong>Raphael Ige</strong>, and I am a dedicated 
      <strong>Salesforce Developer</strong> who builds smart CRM solutions that 
      help businesses grow and strengthen customer relationships.  
    </p>

    <p>
      With a background in <em>Mass Communication</em>, I bring strong 
      communication, storytelling, and problem-solving skills to every project. 
      This allows me to not only build technically sound Salesforce applications, 
      but also ensure they deliver clear business value.
    </p>

    <p>
      My expertise includes Salesforce development, automation, and customization â€” 
      from Apex and SOQL to Lightning Components. I enjoy transforming 
      complex business challenges into seamless, user-friendly solutions.  
    </p>

    <p>
      Beyond coding, I value collaboration, innovation, and continuous learning. 
      My goal is to deliver Salesforce solutions that create real impact 
      for businesses and communities.
